This project proposes a clustering-based collaborative filtering recommender system using the k-means algorithm along with a nature-inspired algorithm to improve the clustering process, which leads to a better recommendation quality. The Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) has been employed to determine the optimal initial centroid for the clustering task. MovieLens 100K dataset was used to evaluate the proposed systemâ€™s performance in terms of precision, recall, and mean absolute error. The dataset was divided into 80% and 20% randomly for training and testing,respectively. The experimental results confirmed over the different number of clusters and the value of mean absolute error decreased from 0.75 to 0.67 as the number of clusters increased from 5 to 40 clusters. The obtained results are compared against other recent nature inspired algorithms, which proved that the proposed recommender system outperforms the considered methods.
